Rules of challenge/path

Each path must start with an @ (does not mean it will start on the [0][0] first position! )

Then its should be followed with dashes until it reaches either letter as the last character or | that means it should go to next line

Next line should start on the character where it ended

How to know to go left or right ?? - function that checks whether we should decrement or increment from the current position?

Go to the right direction and check for valid characters, have a function that checks this

What to do when we have | and the path goes up, how do we know if we should go up or down ? -
